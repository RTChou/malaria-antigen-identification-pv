<p>The table provides a summary of the top antigen candidates and the 90 known <em>P. vivax</em> and <em>P. falciparum</em> antigens, including the 7 reference antigens. The table contains columns for protein IDs, probability scores, antigen/candidate groups, gene products, closest known antigens, the source of the closest known antigen, and the distance to the closest antigens. Grey bars in the table show probability scores or closest euclidean distances, with values ranging from 0 to 1.</p>
<p>To access additional information in the rightmost columns, scroll horizontally. For column filtering, click on the white boxes below the headers and type in threshold criteria (e.g., “PVP01” to select <em>P. vivax</em> proteins). You can also arrange values in ascending or descending order by selecting the arrows adjacent to the headers.</p>
